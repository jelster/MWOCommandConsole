#Don't get left behind on the battlefield! 


Life is tough in the Inner Sphere. Make it easier on yourself with the MWO Command Console - an app that aims to fill in the gaps between the official MWO game features and the information *you* need to dominate your opponents.

##Key Features:
* View multiple designs at once, side-by-side
* See MWO art in its full-sized glory
* Integrates with [SmurfyLab](http://mwo.smurfy-net.de) so you don't have to re-enter any data
* Browse your full catalog of 'Mech designs in a meaningful manner with a UI optimized to display only the most relevant data you need to make the tough choices any MechCommander faces on the battlefield

##App Requirements:
1. the MWO Command Console app requires an API key from (mwo.smurfy-net.de) to download loadout data.
2. This key can come from any user, and can be used to "show off" your catalog to friends. 
3. Alternatively, you can choose to have the app save your API key in the Credential Vault for faster start-up and refresh times.
4. An internet connection is required to refresh data. MWO Command Console stores catalog data for offline viewing between refreshes.
