###Don't get left behind on the battlefield!
Life is tough in the Inner Sphere. Make it easier on yourself with the MWO Command Console - an app that aims to fill in the gaps between the official MWO game features and the information *you* need to dominate your opponents.

###Key Features:
* View multiple designs at once, side-by-side
* See MWO concept art in its' full glory
* Integrates with [SmurfyLab](http://mwo.smurfy-net.de) so you don't have to re-enter any data
* Browse your full catalog of 'Mech designs in a meaningful manner with a UI optimized to display only the most relevant data you need to make the tough choices any MechCommander faces on the battlefield

###Important Requirements
1. This app requires an API key from (mwo.smurfy-net.de) to download loadout data. This key can come from any user, and can be used to "show off" your catalog to friends. Alternatively, you can choose to have the app save your API key for future use, avoiding the need to have to re-enter it when refreshing data.
2. Internet connection required to download data initially. This app has the limited ability to function off-line, allowing you to browse your designs even while not connected.
