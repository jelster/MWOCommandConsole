#Don't get left behind on the battlefield! 

Life is tough in the Inner Sphere. Make it easier on yourself with the MWO Command Console - an app that aims to fill in the gaps between the official MWO game features and the information *you* need to dominate your opponents.

##App Requirements:
1. the MWO Command Console app requires an API key from (mwo.smurfy-net.de) to download loadout data.
2. This key can come from any user, and can be used to "show off" your catalog to friends. 
3. Alternatively, you can choose to have the app save your API key in the Credential Vault for faster start-up and refresh times.
4. An internet connection is required to refresh data. MWO Command Console stores catalog data for offline viewing between refreshes.
